    <img src="images/gibsons.jpg">
    <p>I grew up in Gibsons -- a little country retirement town located on the British Columbian coast, across from Vancouver Island. Even though it is located on the mainland, Gibsons is so isolated that there are no proper roads connecting it to other towns. The only way people can leave or enter Gibsons is via a ferry!</p>
    <p>After finishing high school, I moved to Edmonton to complete a bachelor's degree in communications. I moved to Calgary to complete the internship part of the program, and then got a job as a communications coordinator at a health care (non-profit) organization. During my time there, I had the opportunity to create a temporary website for the company, and to be involved in the full redevelopment of the website. I really enjoyed these projects, so I decided to pursue a career in web development. I've applied to SAIT's web development fast-track program and I will be starting my studies in January 2016.</p>
